# System76 Galago Pro Feet
Feet to elevate the back of System76 Galago Pro

The System76 is a great laptop, though it has a known issue, that the fan runs way too frequently. Hoping to reduce how often the fan turns on I printed a pair of these.

They should sit under the rear edge screw holes, the tips should fit inside those holes to fix them in place.

OpenSCAD document and STL are included.
